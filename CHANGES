This file describes any changes to the file structure of the ODIE system

---- Notes ----

We are in an interim step in development. More changes to follow 
as we break the odie system into component pieces. In it's final form, 
ODIE will be a set of libraries that are called by an application.

At present we have 2 main "applications" that employ ODIE:

preen    - a suite of network and server management scripts
taohttpd - an object oriented server-side scripting engine for web 
           development

Man of the files in the /lib directory are actually stand-alone TCL 
packages from other sources. It was easier to bundle them in this form 
for the early phases of development.

---- CHANGELOG ----
--2004-08-10--
More OSX porting mods

Eliminated the distinction between ::odie::node, 
::odie::node::sqlrecord, and ::odie::node::sqllink 

Moved GetLinks, GetReferences, AccessControlLists to core/node 
baseclass. (Decendents can always elect NOT to use them.)

Further development of the calendar

Added preliminary version of webdav package

Modifications to the firewall generator scripts 
--2004-08-05--

Layout changes to facilitate OSX development. From now on all scripts
should reference $::odie(root) instead of hard-coding /usr/odie. On
OSX odie is installed along with Fink in the /sw/odie directory. On
Windows or MacOS Classic Odie will be stored in a different location
still. 

The Ideal is for ODIE to be completely self-contained. I'm tempted to 
move the odie/etc/network.rc file to the /etc folder. Time will tell...

Linux users won't see any difference with the change. ODIE for Linux, 
BSD, and most other Unixes will be installed under /usr/odie. For Darwin
(OSX) /sw/odie.


--2004-07-26--


Several modifications to keep web development from trampling over 
production system configuration files. The "/usr/odie/apps/netlogon" 
folder has been moved to /usr/local/netlogon. The appropriate areas of 
samba have been alerted to the change. The old location is still 
present, in case some process pulls up an old samba configuration.

The /usr/odie/scripts/sync script has been modified. the "code" option 
has been broken into a few optional pieces. (Code still works the same 
way)


/lib /bin and /scripts are maintained as "lib" 

/etc and .security are now maintained as "config"
/apps is maintainted as "apps"

If you want a full download of the /usr/odie filesystem use "world" 

The update_ntgroups scripts has been move to the netlogon directory. 
The user management adduser and group scripts have been modified to call 
update_ntgroups after every action. For the present, assume that all 
adduser and group modifications should be run on the domain controller.

***

Added revision control system. Every modification to the system is now
performed using /usr/odie/scripts/diff

DIFF generates patches that can be used to roll back modifications to 
the system.

***

Change the name of /usr/odie/scripts/diff to /usr/odie/scripts/revision

Added "merge" command so changes can be rolled into a system you don't
want to sync (i.e. under revision but needs updates anyway)

Several bug fixes 

--END 2004-07-26--
	
2004-07-01 (Approx)
Application modules banished from the /lib directory. A new directory 
has been created called "apps"
