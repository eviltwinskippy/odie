---- Notes ----

We are in an interim step in development. More changes to follow 
as we break the odie system into component pieces. In it's final form, 
ODIE will be a set of libraries that are called by an application.

At present we have 2 main "applications" that employ ODIE:

preen    - a suite of network and server management scripts
taohttpd - an object oriented server-side scripting engine for web 
           development
